🐍 SNAKE MAZE ADVENTURE

Welcome to Snake Maze Adventure — a thrilling journey through a mysterious maze! 🏰

Guide your snake explorer through a maze full of walls, obstacles, and paths, and find the hidden treasure at the destination. Can you reach it without getting lost?

🎮 Game Story

You are a brave little snake 🐍, exploring the ancient labyrinth of the Maze Kingdom.
Your mission is to navigate through winding paths, avoid walls, and reach the red treasure cell. Every step counts, and only the cleverest explorers will make it to the end!

🖌 How It Works

The maze is stored in a 2D array, where:

1 = Wall (dangerous obstacle 🚧)

0 = Safe path 🟩

9 = Treasure (your goal 🎯)

The game uses Java Swing to draw the maze in a window:

Black cells = walls

White cells = free paths

Red cell = treasure

Gridlines help you see the path clearly.

🛠 Features

Framework ready for future enhancements: snake movement, automatic solving, levels, scoring
